# CHIPS is looking for a C developer!

## About CHIPS

CHIPS enables decentralised, peer-to-peer, trustless, on-the-blockchain, casino style games.

At the moment we are working on a poker game, which uses CHIPS and Pangea Protocol.

Pangea Poker is a truly decentralized, peer-to-peer gaming technology. It is the result of complex mathematics & software development with cryptocurrency implementation. The purpose is to build a new form of online poker experience which is trustless, secure, and immutable.

Our core focus right now is to make the game a multiplayer, hence there is no need to understand all the intricacies of the Pangea Protocol implementation and cryptographic details. If you like the job you can always study all of that in detail later.
